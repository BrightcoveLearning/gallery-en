  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>To configure the Search Engine Optimization settings for a Portal Experience, edit the experience and click <strong>Site Configuration &gt; Search Engine Optimization</strong> in the left navigation. The following settings are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#details">Site Details</a> - Configure the site image, keywords and meta tags</li>
      <li><a href="#sitemap">Site Map</a> - Access the site map and search feed URLs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="details">Configuring the site details</h2>
    <p>The Site Details settings can be configured to control how the portal is indexed by search engines. To access the Search Engine Optimization settings, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Edit the experience.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Site Configuration &gt; Search Engine Optimization</strong> in the left navigation.

      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The following settings can be configured:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use site description in search engine results and when site is shared</strong> - When checked, will use the site description in the &lt;meta&gt; description tags, including the Facebook and Twitter meta tags. If not checked, the description for the featured video is used.</li>
      <li><strong>Site Image</strong> - This is the image that will be shown when the home page of a portal site is shared on Facebook or Twitter.</li>
      <li><strong>Keywords</strong> - Meta keywords that will be added to all site pages. Adding "birds,animals,fish, animal world" will result in the following being added to the page HTML:<br />
        <code translate="No">&lt;meta name="keywords" content="birds,animals,fish,animal world"&gt;</code></li>
      <li><strong>Meta Tags</strong> - Used to add additional meta tags for the site. These tags will be added to all site pages. Example:<br />
        <code translate="No">&lt;meta name="myCustomTag" content="myCustomValue"&gt;</code></li>
      <li><strong>Include custom video fields in page metadata</strong> - When checked, will add custom fields as meta tags. For example, a custom field of <strong>year</strong> with a value of <strong>2018</strong> will add:<br />
        <code translate="No">&lt;meta name="year" content="2018"&gt;</code></li>
      <li><strong>Include canonical URL in page metadata</strong> - When checked, will add a <code translate="No"><strong>rel=canonical</strong></code> meta tag in the source which helps improve SEO. This is a feature that tells Google to treat all the pages with the same <code translate="No">rel=canonical</code> link as a single entry. For example, mysite.com/video/mypage.html is the same as mysite.com/video/mypage.html?username=foobar.</li>
      <li><strong>Remove video titles from their URLs</strong> - When checked, the video name will not be included as part of the URL to the video detail page, just the video ID will be in the URL.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sitemap">Viewing the site map &amp; search feed</h2>
    <p>The Site Map settings display the URLs for the site map and search feed. The site map can be downloaded and submitted to search engines. The search feed can be used by most search engine software as a way to add Gallery content to search results. To access the Search Engine Optimization settings, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Edit the experience.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Site Configuration &gt; Search Engine Optimization</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To include the video tags in the site map, check the <strong>Include video tags in site map</strong> option. Note that only the first 32 tags are included. Adding tags to the site map exposes them to search engine web crawlers allowing visitors to find videos based on the video tags.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: These URLs will not be available until the site is published.</aside>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/portal/node18673-sitemap.png" /></figure>
    <p>Site maps are cached for 24 hours. After 24 hours, they are removed from the cache and will be re-generated when they are accessed again. If videos are added to a Portal Experience, they will not be included in the site map until the site map is re-generated (after 24 hours) or until the site is republished.</p>

    <h2 id="noindex">Preventing a site from being indexed</h2>
    <p>There may be times when you want to prevent a site from being indexed by search engines. This can be done by using a <strong>noindex</strong> meta tag. A <strong>noindex</strong> tag tells search engines not to include the page in search results.</p>
    <p><code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow"&gt;</code></p>
    <p>The tag can be added  to the <strong>Header and Footer &gt; Custom Header HTML</strong> or the <strong>Search Engine Optimization &gt; Meta Tags</strong> field.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/portal/node18673-noindex.png" /></figure>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: To learn more about blocking search indexing, see the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/block-indexing">Google documentation</a>.</aside>
    <p>If a site has already been indexed and you need to remove it, Brightcove recommends adding the noindex tag and then <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/ask-google-to-recrawl">ask Google</a> and/or other search sites to reindex.</p>
