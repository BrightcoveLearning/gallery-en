    <p>Gallery allows you to create engaging video experiences without the need for any technical resources. Gallery experiences&nbsp;follow responsive design principles so they look great on desktop, tablets and mobile devices.</p>
    <p>The following is an example of a Portal experience that was built using Brightcove Gallery.</p>

    <p>The main steps to create and publish a Portal experience are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#template">Choose a template</a></li>

    <h2 id="template">Choosing a template</h2>
    <p>When you create a new experience, you start by choosing a template. The template controls the overall look and feel of the experience. The types of templates will vary based upon if you are creating a Portal, Landing Page or Event site. Gallery provides a set of templates that give you the flexibility to deliver the type of video experience needed to engage with your viewers. To learn more about templates and view some sample sites, see the <a href="/node/13548">Overview of Gallery Portal Templates</a> topic.</p>
    <p>After choosing a template, you have the option to <strong>Pre-Populate</strong> the experience with sample content. Clicking <strong>Yes, pre-populate my experience</strong> will pre-populate the experience with videos from your Video Cloud account. This makes it easier to see what the experience will look like as you begin the customization process.</p>

    <p>After you create an experience, the <a href="/node/13554">Gallery Site Editor</a> is used to customize different aspects of the experience. The following types of customizations can be done:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pages</strong> - Images, text and links can be added to page templates to brand the site as needed. To learn more about adding objects to pages, see <a href="/node/13555">Customizing the Content of Portal Experience Pages</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Videos</strong> - Collections are created to select and organize video content. Collections can be configured to use videos from your Video Cloud account or from a YouTube account.

      <li><strong>Style </strong> - The look of the site can be customized by selecting a new theme or by changing the site colors and fonts. To learn more about customizing the site style, see <a href="/node/13568">Customizing the Style of a Portal Experience</a>.</li>

    <h2 id="publish">Previewing and publishing the experience</h2>
    <p>Previewing an experience lets you see how the experience is going to display on mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Experiences&nbsp;can be previewed in a new browser tab or a shareable link can be generated so others can preview the site. Publishing the experience generates a static URL for the site and makes it accessible to viewers. To learn more about previewing and publishing an experience, see <a href="/node/13599">Previewing and Publishing a Portal Experience</a>.</p>
