    <p>Portal Experiences can be configured to display a download link allowing viewers to download video content. Sites can be configured to provide a download link for all videos or specific videos based upon a custom field value. When a video is downloadable, a download link will appear next to the video. The highest quality MP4 rendition available is downloaded.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The video must have at least one MP4 rendition available.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: YouTube videos can't be downloaded.</aside>
