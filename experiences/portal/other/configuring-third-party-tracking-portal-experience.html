    <p>Most Portal templates, including <strong>Immersion</strong>, provide better analytics by enabling third-party tracking tools.</p>
    <p>To configure the Third-Party Tracking settings for a Portal Experience, edit the experience and click <strong>Site Configuration &gt; Third-Party Tracking</strong> in the left navigation. Portal Experiences can be integrated with, or use services provided by, other third-party sites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#google">Google Analytics</a></li>
      <li><a href="#googletag">Google Tag Manager</a></li>
      <li><a href="#eloqua">Eloqua</a></li>
      <li><a href="#marketo">Marketo</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To access the tracking settings, edit the experience and click <strong>Site Configuration &gt; Third-Party Tracking</strong> in the left navigation. <span class="button-blue">Save</span> and <span class="button-blue">Publish</span> the changes</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The settings that are available are based upon the site template that was selected. If the template does not support the option, it will not appear.</aside>

    <h2 id="google">Integrating with Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>Gallery includes the ability to send tracking data to Google Analytics. When you create a new property to track in Google Analytics, Google will provide a Tracking ID and tracking code that must be added to your site. The Tracking ID is used to tell Google Analytics which account and property to send data to and should be entered into the Google Analytics field. The tracking code can be added to your site in one of these ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Custom header/footer HTML</strong> - If you are using <a href="/experiences/portal/customizing/customizing-appearance-and-behavior-portal-experience.html#header_footer">custom header/footer HTML</a> for your site, you can paste the tracking code in as part of the header/footer HTML</li>
      <li><strong>Specify a custom JavaScript file</strong> - Save the tracking code into a .js file hosted on your domain and then point to it using the custom JavaScript property for the site</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By adding the Tracking ID in Site Settings, you get the default "pageview" analytics. Gallery will add the minimum required JavaScript for the same. Adding tracking code as part of a custom header or in a custom JavaScript file allows you to add more specific analytics. For example, you can add custom code for click or other events.</p>
