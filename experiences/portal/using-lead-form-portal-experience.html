  <h1>Using a Lead Form with a Portal Experience</h1>
  <summary>{{ page.description }}</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Lead forms can be used to capture viewer information as viewers watch videos and can be used with the following types of experiences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Portal</li>
      <li>Live Event Portal</li>
      <li>Landing Page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With Portal, Live Event Portal and some Landing Page experiences, lead forms will be displayed inside the player. Lead forms can be configured to display after a specified number of videos have been viewed or after a predetermined time interval has passed. The following is an example of a lead form displayed inside of a player:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="sample lead form" src="/assets/images/experiences/portal/node13702-sample-lead-form.png" /></figure>
    <p>Landing Page experiences can also be configured to display a lead form in the body of the page, for example:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="sample lead form" src="/assets/images/experiences/portal/node13702-landing-page-lead-form.png" /></figure>
    <p>Lead data can be downloaded in comma separated or Excel file formats. The steps to use a lead form are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#create">Create a lead form using the Campaign module</a></li>
      <li><a href="#assign">Assign the lead form to a Campaign-enabled player</a></li>
      <li><a href="#configure">Configure an experience to use the lead form</a></li>
      <li><a href="#export">Export the lead data</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="create">Creating a lead form</h2>
    <p>Lead forms are created using the Campaign module. For complete steps to creating a lead form including all of the options that are available, see <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/campaign/general/creating-campaign-lead-form.html">Creating a Campaign Lead Form</a>. To create a lead form, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the Campaign module.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Lead Forms</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Create Lead Form</strong>.</li>
      <li>Enter a <strong>Name</strong> for the lead form.</li>
      <li>Configure the lead form settings and then click <span class="button-blue">Save</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: No validation is performed on the lead form data that is entered.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: When a lead form is used on a Landing Page experience and the experience is configured to display the form in the body of the page, lead form timing and display settings will be ignored.</aside>

    <h2 id="assign">Assigning a lead form to a Campaign-enabled player</h2>
    <p>Lead forms can only be displayed in Campaign-enabled players. A Campaign-enabled player is a Brightcove Player that is configured with the Campaign plugin. Campaign-enabled players record video engagement data that can be viewed inside of the Campaign module. To create a Campaign-enabled-player, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the Campaign module.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Campaign Players</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Create Player</strong> to create a new Campaign-enabled player.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: It is also possible to <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/campaign/general/creating-campaign-enabled-player.html#existingplayer">add the Campaign plugin to an existing player</a>.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Locate your player and use the <strong>Lead Form</strong> dropdown list to select the lead form to display. Players configured to use a MAP connection can only use custom lead forms. Players configured to use Campaign tracking can only use Campaign lead forms.

      </li>
      <li>(Optional) If you are using Campaign to track video engagement data, the player should be configured with a data connection using the <strong>Connect To</strong> dropdown list.</li>
    </ol>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="configure">Configuring an experience to use a lead form</h2>
    <p>After a lead form has been created and assigned to a Campaign-enabled player, it can be used in a Portal Experience. To configure an experience to use a lead form, follow these steps:</p>

      <li>Open the Gallery module.</li>
