    <h2 id="player">Using a site-specific player</h2>
    <p>By default, all Portal Experiences will use the account-wide default player that was selected as part of the <a href="/settings/configuring-gallery-settings.html">Gallery settings</a>. To use a site-specific player, select <strong>Use site-specific player</strong> and then select a player to use. Campaign-enabled players are indicated with the Campaign icon (<img alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/portal/node18599-audience-icon.png" />). These players are configured with the Campaign plugin and can track video engagement data. A Campaign-enabled player must be used to use a lead form. Click <span class="button-blue">Preview Player</span> to see a player preview. Hovering over the Campaign icon will display the Campaign connection information.</p>

    <h2 id="player_behavior">Configuring player behavior</h2>
    <p>The following player behavior settings can be configured:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Auto-Play Video</strong> - If checked, videos on the detail page will auto play. This setting overrides the <strong>Auto-Play Video on Player Load</strong> setting that is configured in the Players module. This setting is only available for Catalogue, Marquee, Publisher, Chronicle and Classic templates.</li>
      <li><strong>After video finishes playing, autoplay the next video in the collection</strong> - If checked, the next video in a collection will start playing when a video finishes.</li>
      <li><strong>Enable inline playback on iOS devices</strong> - If checked, enables inline playback on iOS devices when using Brightcove Player version 5.10.5 or newer. This setting adds the <code translate="No">playsinline</code> attribute to the player publishing code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="lead_form">Using a lead form</h2>
    <p>Lead forms can be used to capture viewer information during video playback. For information on using a lead form, see <a href="using-lead-form-portal-experience.html">Using a Lead Form with a Portal Experience</a>. When a Campaign-enabled player is selected, the lead form being used (if any) and the Campaign connection information will be displayed.</p>
