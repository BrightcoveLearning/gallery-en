    <p>Depending on the template selected, collection details can be configured. To add collection details, click the <strong> COLLECTION INFORMATION</strong> section.

    <h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2>
    <h4 id="1">1. How are Analytics reported?</h4>
    <p>The Analytics module groups the number of plays for all YouTube videos and reports them as one item.</p>
    <h4 id="2">2. Can a collection contain videos from both YouTube and Video Cloud sources?</h4>
    <p>No. Each Gallery collection can only contain videos from one source. However, Gallery sites can include multiple collections so it is possible to have a Gallery site with content from both YouTube and Video Cloud.</p>
    <h4 id="3">3. Do the YouTube videos in Gallery have to come from my own channel or can I use videos in other publishers’ channels?</h4>
    <p>Videos in your own channel as well as videos from any “featured channel” that you’ve linked to can be used. This allows companies with multiple channels (all linked on YouTube) to include videos from any number of them in a single Gallery site. It is also possible to include videos from channels that don’t belong to you in your Gallery site.</p>
    <h4 id="4">4. How is the YouTube video metadata used in Gallery?</h4>
    <p>The following YouTube metadata is used by Gallery:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ID</li>
      <li>Title</li>
      <li>Description</li>
      <li>High-quality thumbnail URL</li>
      <li>Duration</li>
      <li>Published date</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This metadata is used the same way as the metadata from Video Cloud videos, it gets added to the <code translate="No">&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags in the head, used in the site map, etc.</p>
    <h4 id="5">5. If the Brightcove Player configured for the Gallery site is a Camapign-enabled player, will the Campaign module capture viewing data for YouTube videos?</h4>
    <p>Yes. Lead Forms are also supported.</p>
    <h4 id="6">6. Are Gallery lead forms supported for YouTube videos?</h4>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <h4 id="8">7. Are there any restrictions on which YouTube videos can be used in a Gallery site? For example, if the YouTube video does not "allow embedding", can the video be used? Also, what if a video is marked as unlisted or private?</h4>
    <p>Yes.</p>
