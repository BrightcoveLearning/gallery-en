  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Portal Experiences can easily be previewed during development. Links to preview the site can also be shared. When the site is complete, it can be published to make it publicly available.</p>

    <h2 id="preview">Previewing a Portal Experience</h2>
    <p>Previewing an experience lets you see how the experience is going to display on mobile, tablet and desktop devices. To preview an experience, edit the experience and then click <span class="button-blue">Preview Ë‡</span> in the Gallery Site Editor.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/portal/node13599-preview.png" /></figure>
    <p>There are two options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Responsive Preview</strong> - Opens the experience in a new browser window for preview</li>
      <li><strong>Get Shareable Link</strong> - Provides a preview URL so the preview can be shared with others.</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/portal/node13599-shareable-link.png" /></figure>
    <p>The Shareable URL that is generated is valid for 72 hours.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you have configured any session timeout as part of any access control settings, the 72 hour timeout will override your configured session timeout. When the experience is published, the session timeout (if any) will be enforced.</aside>

    <h2 id="publish">Publishing a Portal Experience</h2>
    <p>Publishing a Portal Experience makes it available to viewers and generates a static URL for the site. To publish an experience, follow these steps:</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you recently made changes to video metadata or playlists, those changes may take up to 6 minutes to appear on published experiences.</aside>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Click on the experience name to open the site in the Site Editor.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">Publish</span>.</li>
      <li>On the Publish Confirmation dialog, click <span class="button-blue">Publish Now</span>.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/portal/node13599-confirm-publish.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>The experience will be published and the site URL will be displayed.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/portal/node13599-publish-url.png" /></figure>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The <code translate="No">bcvp0rtal</code> domain supports SSL by default so sites can also be accessed using <strong>https://</strong>, no setup or SSL certificates are required. It is also possible to secure the site using your own SSL certificates. For information, see <a href="/settings/securing-portal-experience-ssl.html">Securing a Portal Experience with SSL</a>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For information on how to host the experience on your own domain, see <a href="/experiences/portal/assigning-custom-domain-portal-experience.html">Assigning a Custom Domain to a Portal Experience</a>.</aside>
    <p>Once the experience is published, the URL will be displayed as part of the site details on the Gallery home page.</p>

    <h2 id="changes">Publishing changes to a Portal Experience</h2>
