      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The featured video is the video that currently playing. Select an option that determines what the <strong>Featured Video Behavior</strong> will be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Maintain the currently selected video as the featured video</strong> - The selected video is the featured video</li>
