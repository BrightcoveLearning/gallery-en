    <h2 id="search">Configuring site search</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Site Search</strong> settings allow you to enable search for the site. To access the site search settings, click <strong>SITE FEATURES &gt; Site Search </strong>in the left navigation. By checking <strong>Enable site search</strong>, a search field will appear on the site allowing viewers to perform searches against video content. Note that the video name, short and long description and tags will be searched. By default, when search is enabled, ALL videos in your Video Cloud account will be searched. The search is NOT limited to just the videos that appear in your Gallery experience.</p>
    <p>To limit the videos that are returned when searching, there are options to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Include Tag</strong> - The search will only return videos that match the search term entered in the search box AND are tagged with this tag (only a single tag is supported)</li>
      <li><strong>Exclude Tag</strong> - Videos with this tag WILL NOT be returned as part of the search results (only a single tag is supported)</li>
      <li>Enable the <strong>Video Security</strong> setting - Video Security can be enabled as part of the video settings. When enabled, only the videos in collections will be searched (search will only return videos that were added to a collection using a smart playlist or using a custom search). For more information, see <a href="customizing-video-settings-portal-experience.html">Customizing the Video Settings for a Portal Experience</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Search is not supported when multiple video sources are used when creating collections.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Any values entered for <strong>Include Tag</strong> and <strong>Exclude Tag</strong> will also apply to any collections that were added to the site.</aside>
