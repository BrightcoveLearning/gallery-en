  <h1>Organizing Video Collections in a Virtual Event Experience</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to organize video collections in a Virtual Event Experience.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="layout">Template collection organization</h2>
    <p>Using the Gallery Collection Editor, you can select the videos to display on a Virtual Event Experience. Like other portal-type experiences, videos are organized into collections. The order of  the collections in the Gallery Collection Editor will control how they appear on the virtual event homepage.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For information on creating collections and adding  videos to a collection, see <a href="/experiences/portal/adding-videos-portal-experience.html">Adding Videos to a Portal Experience</a>.</aside>
    <p>The Virtual Event template has four main areas where videos are displayed as designated in the sample site:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Featured collection</strong> - Typically used to feature the live or <a href="/experiences/virtual-event/using-simulated-live-videos.html">simulive content</a> that will be displayed throughout the event. This should ideally be ordered based on its go-live time from earliest to latest for the best experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Primary collection</strong> - Can include anything but is typically used to feature specific VOD breakouts or content you want to drive additional attention to</li>
      <li><strong>Secondary collection</strong> - Can include anything but is typically used to feature specific VOD breakouts or content you want to drive additional attention to</li>
      <li><strong>Tracks</strong> - Typically used for VOD content</li>
    </ol>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: To insert a title above the primary/secondary collection, add a static content object to the configuration file. For information, see <a href="/experiences/virtual-event/working-static-content.html">Working with Static Content</a>.</aside>
    <p>When ordering collections in Gallery, the collections should be ordered in the following manner:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collection 1 - Featured collection</li>
      <li>Collection 2 - Secondary collection</li>
      <li>Collection 3 - Primary collection</li>
      <li>Collection 4 - Tracks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the above example, the collections would be created as follows:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/virtual-event/collection-order-example.png" /></figure>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The Virtual Event template supports a maximum of 24 collections.</aside>
    <p>Some additional steps are required to configured the tracks. Tracks are covered in the <a href="#tracks">Configuring event tracks</a> section below. <strong>Playlist</strong> or <strong>Custom</strong> based collections can be used but if the event will use <a href="/experiences/virtual-event/using-role-based-access-control.html">role-based access control</a> to prevent users of certain roles from seeing some content, Playlists should ​not​ be used as playlists don’t support role-based access control filtering.</p>

    <h2 id="tracks">Configuring event tracks</h2>
    <p>When creating the tracks, follow the guidelines below to make sure they appear correctly in the experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The tracks collection should be the fourth collection</li>
      <li>The collection name will appear in the virtual event template so use a meaningful name
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/virtual-event/collection-tracks-ui-sample.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>The tracks collection will be a nested collection, no videos will appear in this collection</li>
      <li>Create child collections under the tracks collection for each track
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/virtual-event/collection-tracks-example.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Assign videos to the child collections, remember, do not use playlists when creating the collections</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="track-url">Configuring the tracks URL</h2>
    <p>Once the collections have been created, the configuration file needs to be updated so that the On-Demand Sessions link in the header will direct to the correct URL. The name used for the tracks collection (collection 4) will be used in the URL to access the tracks page. To ensure the URL is set correctly, confirm the following.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Review the configuration file and locate the <code translate="No">breakout_collection</code> object.</li>
      <li> The <code translate="No">collection</code> parameter contains the URL of the tracks page. For example:<br/>
        <pre><code translate="No">
"breakout_collection": {
    "collection": "/category/videos/tracks",
    "insert_target": ".bc-on-demand-section",
    "insert_mode": "after"
},
          </code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>The last path in the <code translate="No">collection</code> URL should reflect the name of your tracks collection (collection 4). For example, if your tracks collection (collection 4) is named Sessions, the collection parameter would be updated to:<br/>
        <pre><code translate="No">
"collection": "/category/videos/sessions",      
          </code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>To verify the configuration, click the On-Demand Sessions link in the header. The tracks session should appear. Clicking on a track should open the videos in a track. If you see a 404 error, there is a configuration issue.</li>
    </ol>
