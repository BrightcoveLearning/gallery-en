    <p>Using the Gallery Collection Editor, you can select the videos to display on a Virtual Event Experience. Like other portal-type experiences, videos are organized into collections.</p>
    <p>To add videos to a Virtual Event Experience, edit an experience and then click <strong>Videos</strong> in the left navigation.</p>

    <h2 id="layout">Video collection organization</h2>
    <p>The order of  the collections will control how they appear on the virtual event homepage.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For information on creating collections and adding  videos to a collection, see <a href="/experiences/portal/videos/adding-videos-portal-experience.html">Adding Videos to a Portal Experience</a>.</aside>
    <p>The Virtual Event template has four main areas where videos are displayed as designated in the sample site:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Featured collection</strong> - Typically used to feature the live or <a href="/experiences/virtual-event/videos/using-simulated-live-videos.html">simulive content</a> that will be displayed throughout the event. This should ideally be ordered based on its go-live time from earliest to latest for the best experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Primary collection</strong> - Can include anything but is typically used to feature specific VOD content you want to drive additional attention to</li>
      <li><strong>Secondary collection</strong> - Can include anything but is typically used to feature specific VOD content you want to drive additional attention to</li>
      <li><strong>Tracks</strong> - Typically used for VOD content</li>
    </ol>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The Featured, Primary and Secondary collections support a maximum of 24 videos.</aside>
    <p>When ordering collections in Gallery, the collections should be ordered in the following manner:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collection 1 - Featured collection</li>
      <li>Collection 2 - Primary collection</li>
      <li>Collection 3 - Secondary collection</li>
      <li>Collection 4 - Tracks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the above example, the collections would be created as follows:</p>

    <h2 id="tracks">Configuring event tracks</h2>
    <p>When creating the tracks, follow the guidelines below to make sure they appear correctly in the experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The collection names will appear in the virtual event template so use meaningful names
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/virtual-event/collection-tracks-ui-sample.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>The tracks collection will be a nested collection, no videos will appear in this collection</li>
      <li>The tracks collection should be the fourth collection</li>
      <li>Create child collections under the tracks collection for each track
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/virtual-event/collection-tracks-example.png" /></figure>
      </li>
    </ul>
