    <h2 id="issues">Known issues</h2>
    <h3>Unable to select an audio output device in some browsers</h3>
    <p>Firefox and Safari have known issues disallowing them from listing audio output devices on these browsers. While clients can continue the meeting using the default device, they will not be able to select devices in meetings. Chrome and Firefox on iOS also have the same issue.
      
      Android Chrome has a known issue switching between Bluetooth audio output devices. While clients can continue the meeting using the default device, there is a bug related to switching to a Bluetooth audio output.</p>
