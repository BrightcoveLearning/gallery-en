    <p>Interactive rooms provide the ability to hold  online meetings that support audio, video and screen sharing. Interactive rooms are created by adding a session with a <strong>Session Type</strong> of <strong>Interactive Room</strong> to a virtual event agenda.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Interactive Rooms currently support up to 25 participants (speakers and attendees). If more than 25 participants attempt to enter a room, they will receive a message that the room is full.</aside>
    <p>When the session start date and time are reached, a <strong>JOIN SESSION</strong> button will appear on the agenda. Attendees can click the button to enter the interactive room.</p>

    <p>To use interactive rooms, the Virtual Event Experience must be secured using SSO. The experience will inspect the user ID used to login. If the user ID matches an email address for one of the session speakers, that user will be presented with the speaker interface. All other users will be presented with the attendee interface.</p>

    <h4>Enabling attendee cameras and mics</h4>
    <p>Presenters have the ability to enable and disable mics and cameras for attendees. When the presenter disables cameras and mics, all attendees will be muted and cameras will not be displayed. When the meeting begins, mics and cameras are enabled by default.</p>

    <h2 id="issues">Known issues/behaviors</h2>
    <h4>Video and audio settings</h4>
    <p>Video and audio settings are not persisted between sessions. You must select new settings everytime a new session is started.</p>
    <h4>Unable to select an audio output device in some browsers</h4>
    <p>Firefox and Safari have known issues disallowing them from listing audio output devices on these browsers. While clients can continue the meeting using the default device, they will not be able to select devices in meetings. Chrome and Firefox on iOS also have the same issue.
      
      Android Chrome has a known issue switching between Bluetooth audio output devices. While clients can continue the meeting using the default device, there is a bug related to switching to a Bluetooth audio output.</p>
    <h4>Presenters sharing videos</h4>
    <p>Attendees will have no audio from  videos that are screen shared by a presenter. This is the expected behavior.</p>
    <h4>If you turn on your camera and put the browser in background, others in the meeting will see black tile in Safari/Chrome/Firefox in iOS and frozen tile in Chrome in Android</h4>
    <p>This is the default behavior that is specific to each browser. In Android, the video stream is muted when in background and thus, the video will show the last frame. Note that for Android, if an attendee joins later after the video stream is in background, it will show as a blank tile since the last frame is blank.</p>
