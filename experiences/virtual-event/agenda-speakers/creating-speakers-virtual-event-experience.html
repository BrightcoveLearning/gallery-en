    <p>You  may have created a list of event speakers in a  third-party tool, for example, Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.  The Agenda module provides the ability to upload a .csv file of event speakers. Once the speakers file is uploaded, speaker information can be edited using the Agenda module.</p>

    <p>When creating the  speakers file, you can download a sample speakers template and edit it or use an existing speakers file you may have created. The Agenda module looks for the existence of specific column names. These columns will be mapped to the appropriate speaker fields. Other columns that may be in your speaker file will be ignored during import. In order to upload a speaker file, the following columns are required:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code translate="No">first_name</code> - Speaker first name</li>
      <li><code translate="No">last_name</code> - Speaker last name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following columns are optional, but if they exist in your speakers file, they will also be imported:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code translate="No">id</code> - Cannot be user defined. This is the ID that would be populated if the user exported a list of speakers as a CSV. This is used to update existing entries in the database.</li>
      <li><code translate="No">email</code> - Speaker  email address</li>
      <li><code translate="No">title</code> - Speaker title</li>
      <li><code translate="No">company</code> - Speaker company</li>
      <li><code translate="No">bio</code> - Speaker bio</li>
      <li><code translate="No">image</code> - Speaker image</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you are ready to import your speakers into the Agenda module, export it as a .csv file. <strong>The Agenda module can only import a .csv file.</strong> For information on how to upload your speakers file into the Agenda module, see <a href="managing-event-speakers.html">Managing  Event Speakers</a>. </p>
