  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Role-based access control can be used to filter the sessions that appear in the session agenda based on a user's role. Role-based access control relies on a specified SAML attribute on the user object  returned by the user management system (i.e. registration system, SSO). Rules are defined based on user roles and session tags. Brightcove recommends that all sessions have at least one tag for the role-based filtering to occur.</p>

    <h2 id="start">Before you get started</h2>
    <p>Before configuring role-based access control for a Virtual Event Experience, these initial setup steps should be completed:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart" >
      <li>You should create a Virtual Event Experience and have created an event agenda.</li>
      <li>The Virtual Event Experience should be secured using an access control profile.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="roles">Roles and tags</h2>
    <p>To configure role-based access control, start by determining how the sessions will be restricted and then create the appropriate role-based access tags that will be assigned to each user and each session. For example, you may decide to use the following roles/tags:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>standard</li>
      <li>enterprise</li>
      <li>vip</li>
    </ul>
    Users in your SSO will be assigned one these roles and all agenda sessions will be tagged with one or more of these values. Role-based access control will  filter the agenda so  users only see the  sessions they have access to. For example, a user with a role of &quot;<strong>standard</strong>&quot; will only see sessions that are tagged &quot;<strong>standard</strong>&quot;.</section>

    <h2 id="assign-roles">Assigning roles to users in Auth0</h2>
    <p>All users in your SSO should be assigned a role. The following steps can be used to assign roles to users using Auth0 SSO.</p>

    <h2 id="assign">Assigning a role-based access profile</h2>
    <p>Once you have created a role-based access profile to control access to content, associate it with the experience.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Copy the access control profile to the clipboard.</li>
      <li>Open the Gallery module.</li>
      <li>Edit the experience.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Appearance and Behavior &gt; Custom</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
      <li>Paste the access profile configuration  into the <strong>Custom Template JSON</strong> field.

      </li>
      <li>Click<strong> Save</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Make sure you <a href="/portal/previewing-and-publishing-portal-experience.html">republish the experience</a> so the changes appear.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="attributes">Exposing SAML attributes</h2>
    <p>In order for the experience to access the role attribute  from your SSO/registration system provider, ensure that the SSO settings are configured correctly.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Open the Gallery module.</li>
      <li>Click the settings icon (<img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/get-started/icon-settings.png" />)  on the home page.</li>
      <li>In the left navigation, click <strong>Access Control Profiles</strong>. A list of created Access Control Profiles will be displayed.</li>
      <li>Click the edit icon for the profile the Virtual Event Experience is using.</li>
      <li>Confirm that the <strong>Expose all attributes</strong> option at the bottom of the page is checked.
