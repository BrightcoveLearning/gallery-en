    <p>Static content objects such as a welcome message are used to inject custom HTML into the template. This sample hero banner was constructed using a combination of text and images and injected into the top of the page.</p>
    <p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/virtual-event/template-overview-hero-banner.png" /></figure>
    </p>
    <p>The Gallery Site Editor also provides the ability to <a href="../customizing-content-virtual-event-experience-pages.html#logo">add a welcome message and/or image</a> to the home page. Adding a static content image to the config file should be used when you are using <a href="../using-role-based-access-control.html">role-based access control</a> to conditionally display different images to different groups of users.</p>
    <p>Static content can be any HTML and can be injected anywhere in the template. Static content objects are added to the <code translate="No">static_content</code> object in  the configuration file. For information on how to position static content on the page, see <a href="/experiences/virtual-event/pages-to-delete/positioning-content-homepage.html">Positioning Content on the Home Page</a>.</p>
