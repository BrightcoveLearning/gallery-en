    <h2 id="images">Images</h2>
    <p> Various images are used throughout the Virtual Event template. Image recommendations are listed below.</p>
    <h3>Background Image</h3>
    <p>The image size depends on the breakpoints the customer is trying to support, more often than not 1920x1080 works, but the image should be optimized so it's not gigantic for best performance. </p>
    <h3>Header Logo</h3>
    <p>The header logo image will be proportionally scaled down to 178px wide.</p>
    <h3>Agenda</h3>
    <p>Default image size is 320px x 180px. Images will be cropped to this size.</p>
    <h3>Speakers</h3>
    <p>Speaker images should have a max width of 200px. Images will not be resized.  By default, the template CSS configures the speaker images with a border-radius of 50% which will make the images circular. The speaker bio displayed below the speaker is limited to approximately 3 lines of 15 words.</p>
    <h3>Sponsors</h3>
    <p>The sponsor images will be resized to 100px wide and have opacity set to 80%. <a href="customizing-sponsors-virtual-event-experience.html">Sample CSS</a> is provided to override this behavior.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2>
    <p>The template is optimized to work with the <strong>Roboto Condensed</strong> font.  This font can be assigned using the <strong>Style</strong> menu inside of the Gallery interface. Other fonts can be used but may require changes to CSS files. For information about using custom fonts, see <a href="/experiences/portal/using-custom-fonts-portal-experience.html">Using Custom Fonts in a Portal Experience</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="schedule">Agenda</h2>
    <p>The event agenda lists the schedule of live events and other sessions. When an agenda has been created and published, it will appear on the event homepage. For  information on creating the event agenda, see <a href="/experiences/virtual-event/managing-agenda-virtual-event-experience.html">Managing the Event Agenda</a>.</p>
