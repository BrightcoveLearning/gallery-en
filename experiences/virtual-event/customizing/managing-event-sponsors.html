    <p>Using the Gallery Site Editor, you can manage the event sponsors that appear on the experience homepage. Sponsors are organized into sponsor groups which represent the various sponsor levels. For example, your event might have &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;silver&quot; and &quot;bronze&quot; level sponsors. Once sponsor groups are created, sponsors can be added into each group. Sponsor groups and logos will appear on the experience homepage. </p>
