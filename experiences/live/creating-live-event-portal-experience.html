  <h1>Creating a Live Event Portal Experience</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn about creating a Live Event Portal Experience.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Gallery provides a Live Event Portal template which can be used to create Portal Experiences that will broadcast live events. After creating a new Live Event Portal Experience, you will be prompted to pre-populate the experience. If you choose <strong>Yes, pre-populate my experience</strong>, the site template will display some default images, twitter feed, and some sample videos from your account to help give you a better feel for the layout of the template.</p>

    <p>The Live Event Portal template contains several home page states which will be displayed before, during and after the event.</p>
    <p>To create and broadcast a live event using Gallery, the following steps must be performed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#event">Create a live event using Video Cloud</a></li>
      <li><a href="#pre">Create the pre-event state</a></li>
      <li><a href="#live">Create the event state</a></li>
      <li><a href="#post">Create the post event state</a></li>
      <li><a href="#setstate">Set the home page state</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These steps are covered in more detail in the following sections.</p>

    <h2 id="pre">Creating the pre-event state</h2>
    <p>The pre-event state is how the site will appear before the live event occurs. The goal of the pre-event state is to capture interest and create "buzz" around the event.</p>
    <p>For more information on creating the pre-event state, see <a href="/experiences/live/creating-pre-event-state-portal-event-experience.html">Creating the Pre-Event State for a Portal Event Experience</a>.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="live">Creating the live-event state</h2>
    <p>The live-event state is when the live event is being broadcast. The goal of the live-event state is to provide a high quality viewing experience and to keep viewers engaged.</p>

  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="post">Creating the post-event state</h2>
    <p>The post-event state is when the live event has finished. The goal of the post-event state is to encourage site visitors to engage more with the brand, provide an on demand version of the live event and provide links to related content.</p>

    <h2 id="setstate">Setting the home page state</h2>
    <p>Once the pre-, live and post-event state pages have been created, the Gallery site can be configured so the home page displays the appropriate state. To change the home page state, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Edit the Live Event Portal Experience.</li>
      <li>The current home page state will be displayed in the left navigation.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/live/node15690-homepage-state.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Change</strong>. The Change Home Page dialog will open.</li>
      <li>Select a home page state and then click <strong>Change</strong>.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/live/node15690-select-state.png" /></figure>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The experience MUST be republished after the home page state is changed. Note that it may take a couple of minutes for the state change to be reflected on the live site.</p>
