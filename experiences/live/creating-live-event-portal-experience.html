    <p>Gallery provides a Live Event Portal template which can be used to create Portal Experiences that will broadcast live events. After creating a new Live Event Portal Experience, you will be prompted to pre-populate the experience. If you choose <strong>Yes, pre-populate my experience</strong>, the site template will display some default images, twitter feed, and some sample videos from your account to help give you a better feel for the layout of the template.</p>

    <p>The Live Event Portal template contains several home page states which will be displayed before, during and after the event.</p>
    <p>To create and broadcast a live event using Gallery, the following steps must be performed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#event">Create a live event using Video Cloud</a></li>
      <li><a href="#pre">Create the pre-event state</a></li>
      <li><a href="#live">Create the event state</a></li>
      <li><a href="#post">Create the post event state</a></li>
      <li><a href="#setstate">Set the home page state</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These steps are covered in more detail in the following sections.</p>

    <h2 id="pre">Creating the pre-event state</h2>
    <p>The pre-event state is how the site will appear before the live event occurs. The goal of the pre-event state is to capture interest and create "buzz" around the event.</p>
    <p>For more information on creating the pre-event state, see <a href="/experiences/live/creating-pre-event-state-portal-event-experience.html">Creating the Pre-Event State for a Portal Event Experience</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="live">Creating the live-event state</h2>
    <p>The live-event state is when the live event is being broadcast. The goal of the live-event state is to provide a high quality viewing experience and to keep viewers engaged.</p>
    <p>For more information on creating the live-event state, see <a href="/experiences/live/creating-live-event-state-portal-event-experience.html">Creating the Live Event State for a Portal Event Experience</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="post">Creating the post-event state</h2>
    <p>The post-event state is when the live event has finished. The goal of the post-event state is to encourage site visitors to engage more with the brand, provide an on demand version of the live event and provide links to related content.</p>
    <p>For more information on creating the post-event state, see <a href="/experiences/live/creating-post-event-state-portal-event-experience.html">Creating the Post-Event State for a Portal Event Experience</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="archive">Creating the archive and video detail pages</h2>
    <p>The Live Event template also supports Video Archive and Video Detail pages. The Video Archive page will display all the video collections that have been created. By default, videos in the first collection will be displayed below the live player. Clicking the Video Archive link on the homepage will open the Video Archive page displaying all the video collections.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The Video Archive page is used to display VOD videos, it has no relation to archiving a live event.</aside>
    <p>For more information on creating collections, see <a href="/experiences/portal/videos/adding-videos-portal-experience.html">Adding Videos to a Portal Experience</a>.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="setstate">Setting the home page state</h2>
    <p>Once the pre-, live and post-event state pages have been created, the Gallery site can be configured so the home page displays the appropriate state. To change the home page state, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Edit the Live Event Portal Experience.</li>
      <li>The current home page state will be displayed in the left navigation.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/live/node15690-homepage-state.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">the settings icon (<img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/live/icon-gear.png" />)</span>. The Change Home Page dialog will open.</li>
      <li>Select a home page state and then click <strong>Change</strong>.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/live/node15690-select-state.png" /></figure>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The experience MUST be republished after the home page state is changed. Note that it may take a couple of minutes for the state change to be reflected on the live site.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: You, the publisher, are responsible for changing the home page state. Gallery will never automatically switch the home page  state.</aside>
          <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The live video will not autoplay when switching from the Pre-Event to Live event states. Most browser vendors will NOT allow videos to autoplay.</aside>
