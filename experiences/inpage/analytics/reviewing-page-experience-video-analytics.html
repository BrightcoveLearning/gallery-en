    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Reporting time zone</h3>
      <p>Data is based upon the account's reporting timezone. The reporting time zone is used to calculate day boundaries for reporting data. Changing the reporting time zone setting only affects data going forward, and changes are not applied retroactively. If you change the timezone setting, you may see a flat spot or a spike in your data when looking at day boundaries where the change was applied. Updates to the timezone setting may not take effect immediately, and analytics data may continue to refer to the old setting until the system processes the changes.</p>
      <p>The reporting time zone can be configured as part of the account settings. For information on changing the reporting time zone, see <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/general/managing-account-settings.html#account_settings">Managing Account Settings</a>.</p>
