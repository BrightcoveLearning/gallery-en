  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>The settings control various aspects of an In-Page Experience. The following settings are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#playersettings">Player</a></li>
      <li><a href="#videosettings">Video</a></li>
      <li><a href="#language">Language</a></li>

    <h2 id="playersettings">Configuring player settings</h2>
    <p>The player settings control the player that is used and the player behavior for the experience. To configure the player settings, edit the experience and then click <strong>Settings &gt; Player</strong> in the left navigation.</p>

    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Selecting a player</h3>
      <p>To select a player to use for the In-Page Experience, select a player from the <strong>Available Players</strong> dropdown list. The list will display all the players in your Video Cloud account.</p>
      <p>After you select a player, the player preview will display a preview of the selected player.</p>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: When using an In-Page Experience, player styling is only reflected while a video is playing. Player styling will not be seen in the BEFORE PLAY or AFTER PLAY states.</aside>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Setting player behavior</h3>
      <p>Player settings can be configured to customize the player behavior. The following settings are available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>When video playback is complete</strong> determines what happens when a video finishes playing:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Display "After Playing" state for the experience</strong> - When selected, the experience will enter the <strong>AFTER PLAY</strong> state when a video completes.</li>
            <li><strong>Remain on current video</strong> - When selected, the experience will stay in the <strong> PLAYING</strong> state when a video completes. Select this option to display the custom endscreen (configured in the Players module) that is configured for the player. Components displayed during the <strong>PLAYING</strong> state will also remain visible. This option has the side effect of effectively removing the<strong> AFTER PLAY</strong> state from the experience.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enable inline playback on iOS devices</strong> - If checked, enables inline playback on iOS devices when using Brightcove Player version 5.10.5 or newer.</li>
        <li><strong>Advance to next video automatically</strong> - If checked, the next video in the experience will be played when the current video finishes playing. This setting also determines whether to display a countdown timer in the <strong>AFTER PLAY</strong> state. If it is enabled, there will be a timer. When the timer reaches zero, the experience will transition to the <strong>PLAYING</strong> state of the next video.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Working with IP restricted accounts</h3>
      <p><a href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/content-protection/restricting-video-playback-using-ip-address.html">IP restricted accounts</a> outside of North America require modification of the Playback API <code translate="No">base_url</code> in the player. In-Page Experiences will copy this <code translate="No">base_url</code> from the player when the experience is created and when a player is selected for the experience. If the <code translate="No">base_url</code> on a player for an existing experience is changed, Gallery will not automatically update this value since we don't know that it changed. As a workaround, publishers should follow these steps as a workaround:</p>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
        <li>Edit the experience.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Settings &gt; Player</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
        <li>Select a different player than the one that's currently selected.</li>
        <li>Re-select the initial player.</li>
        <li><strong>Save</strong> and then <strong>publish</strong> the experience.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This will update the <code translate="No">base_url</code> for the experience to match that of the initial player.</p>
    </div>
    <p>When done, click <strong>Save</strong> to save the changes.</p>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Working with domain restricted Players</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;Domain restricted players require modification of the Policy Key&nbsp;in the player. In-Page Experiences will copy this <font face="monospace">policy_key</font>&nbsp;from the player when the experience is created and when a player is selected for the experience. If the&nbsp;<code translate="No">policy_key</code>&nbsp;on a player for an existing experience is changed, Gallery will not automatically update this value since we don't know that it changed. As a workaround, publishers should follow these steps as a workaround if they update their list of approved domains:</p>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
        <li>Edit the experience.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Settings &gt; Player</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
        <li>Select a different player than the one that's currently selected.</li>
        <li>Re-select the initial player.</li>
        <li><strong>Save</strong> and then <strong>publish</strong> the experience.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This will update the <code translate="No">policy_key</code>&nbsp;for the experience to match that of the initial player.</p>
    </div>
    <p>When done, click <strong>Save</strong> to save the changes.</p>

    <h2 id="videosettings">Configuring video settings</h2>
    <p>The video settings control some of the video display options and control whether the video can be downloaded. These settings only apply when the video is in the <strong>PLAYING</strong> state. To configure the video settings, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Edit the experience.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Settings &gt; Video</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-video-settings.png" /></figure>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Related Link</h3>
      <p>If checked, the related link for the video will appear with the video info. The related link is configured as part of the <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/media/editing-video-properties-using-media-module.html#videoinfo">video properties in the Media module</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>If checked, the long description for the video will appear instead of the short description with the video info. The short and long descriptions are configured as part of the <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/media/editing-video-properties-using-media-module.html#videoinfo">video properties in the Media module</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Watched Indicator</h3>
      <p>If checked, a watched indicator (<img alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-watched-indicator.png" />) will appear on videos which have been watched during a user's session.</p>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The watched indicator will be styled using the <strong>OVERLAY BANNER</strong> properties in the STYLE menu.</aside>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Downloads</h3>
      <p>In-Page Experiences can be configured so viewers can download videos. The download link allows the viewer to download the highest quality rendition. Select a download option:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not allow video downloads</li>
        <li>Provide a download link for each video</li>
        <li>Provide a download link for each video based upon a custom field value - Define a custom field and then set that field to true for any video that can be downloaded. For complete steps on configuring a download link for each video, see <a href="configuring-video-downloads-page-experience.html">Configuring Video Downloads for an In-Page Experience</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The video must have at least one MP4 rendition available.</aside>
    </div>
    <p>When done, click <strong>Save</strong> to save the changes.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="language">Configuring language settings</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Language</strong> setting can be used to indicate that video metadata should be displayed in the same language that the experience is configured for. For information, see <a href="/portal/using-multi-lingual-metadata.html">Using Multi-Lingual Metadata</a>.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-language-settings.png" /></figure>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="social">Configuring social settings</h2>
    <p>The social settings control the social sharing options that are available when videos are playing. Social sharing icons appear above the player when the experience is in the <strong>PLAYING</strong> state. When a video is shared to a social media site, a link or image will appear directing the viewer back to the experience.</p>
    <p>Gallery uses a social media metadata proxy service. This service is used whenever a video or event is shared out from an In-Page Experience, and is part of the URL which is shared. It will redirect viewers to the page on which the In-Page Experience is embedded, however, crawlers will see metadata about the video/event instead. In this way, social media crawlers will get information about the video/event which is being shared and can present more relevant information to the end-user on the social media site, while end-users are still able to access the original page.</p>
    <p>To configure the social settings, edit the experience and then click <strong>Settings &gt; Social</strong> in the left navigation.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The social settings can also be configured when editing the experience in the <strong>LAYOUT</strong> state by clicking on the <em>Configure sharing</em> link.</aside>

    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Display</h3>
      <p>The Display setting determines how the social icons are displayed. When the <strong>Share</strong> option (<img alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-share-icon.png" />) is selected, the sharing icons will slide in from the right side of the player.</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-share-settings.png" /></figure>
      <p>When the social icons option (<img alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-social-icon.png" />) is selected, the social icons will appear above the player.</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-social-icons.png" /></figure>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Sharing Options</h3>
      <p>Select the social sharing options to display. Some platforms offer the ability to enter a custom message. Click on the social platform name to enter a custom message. Click on a link to use the video URL, name or short description values in the message.</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-social-custom-message.png" /></figure>
      <p>Click on the social platform name again to hide the custom message settings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Social Metadata for Shared Links</h3>
      <p>Enter the <strong>Page URL</strong> of the page where the experience is embedded and then click <span class="button-blue">Generate</span>. This will allow social sites to display the thumbnail image, title, and description of the first video when viewers share your experience.</p>

    <h2 id="seo">Accessing SEO settings</h2>
    <p>The SEO settings allow you to generate a site map and search feed for the In-Page Experience. To generate a site map and/or search feed, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Edit the experience.</li>

    <h2 id="tracking">Configuring tracking</h2>
    <p>The tracking setting can be used to send tracking data to Google Analytics. To configure the tracking setting, edit the experience and then click <strong>Settings &gt; Tracking</strong> in the left navigation.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-tracking.png" /></figure>
    <p>By providing a Google Analytics Tracking ID in the Tracking page, events occurring on the experience will be submitted to a Google Analytics account. Each event has a category in the form of <strong>Brightcove Experience {name} - {state}</strong> where <strong>{name}</strong> is the name of the experience, and <strong>{state}</strong> is the current playback state of the component (before, during, after). Each event may also have a relevant label, which is usually the ID of the video on which the event occurs. The following events are currently tracked (more will be added in the future as needed):</p>
