  <h1>Configuring the Settings for an In-Page Experience</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to customize the settings for an In-Page experience.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>The settings control various aspects of an In-Page experience. The following settings are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#playersettings">Player</a></li>
      <li><a href="#videosettings">Video</a></li>
      <li><a href="#social">Social</a></li>

    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: After making any changes to an experience, make sure you <a href="../../docs/inpage/node/16795">republish the experience</a> so the changes appear on sites that display the experience.</aside>

    <h2 id="playersettings">Configuring player settings</h2>
    <p>The player settings control the player that is used and the player behavior for the experience. To configure the player settings, edit the experience and then click <strong>SETTINGS &gt; Player</strong> in the left navigation.</p>

    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Selecting a player</h3>
      <p>To select a player to use for the In-Page experience, select a player from the <strong>Available Players</strong> dropdown list. The list will display all the players in your Video Cloud account.</p>
      <p>After you select a player, the player preview will display a preview of the selected player.</p>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: When using an In-Page experience, player styling is only reflected while a video is playing. Player styling will not be seen in the BEFORE PLAY or AFTER PLAY states.</aside>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Setting player behavior</h3>
      <p>Player settings can be configured to customize the player behavior. The following settings are available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>When video playback is complete</strong> determines what happens when a video finishes playing:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Display "After Playing" state for the experience</strong> - When selected, the experience will enter the <strong>AFTER PLAY</strong> state when a video completes.</li>
            <li><strong>Remain on current video</strong> - When selected, the experience will stay in the <strong> PLAYING</strong> state when a video completes. Select this option to display the custom endscreen (configured in the Players module) that is configured for the player. Components displayed during the <strong>PLAYING</strong> state will also remain visible. This option has the side effect of effectively removing the<strong> AFTER PLAY</strong> state from the experience.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enable inline playback on iOS devices</strong> - If checked, enables inline playback on iOS devices when using Brightcove Player version 5.10.5 or newer.</li>
        <li><strong>Advance to next video automatically</strong> - If checked, the next video in the experience will be played when the current video finishes playing. This setting also determines whether to display a countdown timer in the <strong>AFTER PLAY</strong> state. If it is enabled, there will be a timer. When the timer reaches zero, the experience will transition to the <strong>PLAYING</strong> state of the next video.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Working with IP restricted accounts</h3>
      <p><a href="/node/8065">IP restricted accounts</a> outside of North America require modification of the Playback API <code>base_url</code> in the player. In-Page experiences will copy this <code>base_url</code> from the player when the experience is created and when a player is selected for the experience. If the <code>base_url</code> on a player for an existing experience is changed, Gallery will not automatically update this value since we don't know that it changed. As a workaround, publishers should follow these steps as a workaround:</p>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
        <li>Go to the Player Settings page for the experience.</li>
        <li>Select a different player than the one that's currently selected.</li>
        <li>Re-select the initial player.</li>
        <li><strong>Save</strong> and then <strong>publish</strong> the experience.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This will update the <code>base_url</code> for the experience to match that of the initial player.</p>
    </div>
    <p>When done, click <strong>Save</strong> to save the changes.</p>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Working with domain restricted Players</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;Domain restricted players require modification of the Policy Key&nbsp;in the player. In-Page experiences will copy this <font face="monospace">policy_key</font>&nbsp;from the player when the experience is created and when a player is selected for the experience. If the&nbsp;<code>policy_key</code>&nbsp;on a player for an existing experience is changed, Gallery will not automatically update this value since we don't know that it changed. As a workaround, publishers should follow these steps as a workaround if they update their list of approved domains:</p>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
        <li>Go to the Player Settings page for the experience.</li>
        <li>Select a different player than the one that's currently selected.</li>
        <li>Re-select the initial player.</li>
        <li><strong>Save</strong> and then <strong>publish</strong> the experience.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This will update the <code>policy_key</code>&nbsp;for the experience to match that of the initial player.</p>
    </div>
    <p>When done, click <strong>Save</strong> to save the changes.</p>

    <h2 id="videosettings">Configuring video settings</h2>
    <p>The video settings control some of the video display options and control whether the video can be downloaded. These settings only apply when the video is in the <strong>PLAYING</strong> state. To configure the video settings, edit the experience and then click <strong>SETTINGS &gt; Video</strong> in the left navigation.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-video-settings.png" /></figure>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Related Link</h3>
      <p>If checked, the related link for the video will appear with the video info. The related link is configured as part of the <a href="../../docs/inpage/node/15482#videoinfo">video properties in the Media module</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>If checked, the long description for the video will appear instead of the short description with the video info. The short and long descriptions are configured as part of the <a href="../../docs/inpage/node/15482#videoinfo">video properties in the Media module</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Watched Indicator</h3>
      <p>If checked, a watched indicator (<img alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-watched-indicator.png" />) will appear on videos which have been watched during a user's session.</p>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The watched indicator will be styled using the <strong>OVERLAY BANNER</strong> properties in the STYLE menu.</aside>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Downloads</h3>
      <p>In-page experiences can be configured so viewers can download videos. The download link allows the viewer to download the highest quality rendition. Select a download option:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not allow video downloads</li>
        <li>Provide a download link for each video</li>
        <li>Provide a download link for each video based upon a custom field value - Define a custom field and then set that field to true for any video that can be downloaded. For complete steps on configuring a download link for each video, see <a href="../../docs/inpage/node/16829">Configuring Video Downloads for an In-Page Experience</a>.</li>

    <h2 id="social">Configuring social settings</h2>
    <p>The social settings control the social sharing options that are available when videos are playing. Social sharing icons appear above the player when the experience is in the <strong>PLAYING</strong> state. When a video is shared to a social media site, a link or image will appear directing the viewer back to the experience.</p>
    <p>Gallery uses a social media metadata proxy service. This service is used whenever a video or event is shared out from an In-Page experience, and is part of the URL which is shared. It will redirect viewers to the page on which the In-Page experience is embedded, however, crawlers will see metadata about the video/event instead. In this way, social media crawlers will get information about the video/event which is being shared and can present more relevant information to the end-user on the social media site, while end-users are still able to access the original page.</p>
    <p>To configure the social settings, edit the experience and then click <strong>SETTINGS &gt; Social</strong> in the left navigation.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The social settings can also be configured when editing the experience in the <strong>LAYOUT</strong> state by clicking on the <em>Configure sharing</em> link.</aside>

    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Display</h3>
      <p>The Display setting determines how the social icons are displayed. When the <strong>Share</strong> option (<img alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node16793-share-icon.png" />) is selected, the sharing icons will slide in from the right side of the player.</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-share-settings.png" /></figure>
      <p>When the social icons option (<img alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node16793-social-icon.png" />) is selected, the social icons will appear above the player.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Sharing Options</h3>
      <p>Select the social sharing options to display. Some platforms offer the ability to enter a custom message. Click on the social platform name to enter a custom message. Click on a link to use the video URL, name or short description values in the message.</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-social-custom-message.png" /></figure>
      <p>Click on the social platform name again to hide the custom message settings.</p>

    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Social Metadata for Shared Links</h3>
      <p>Enter the <strong>Page URL</strong> of the page where the experience is embedded and then click <strong>Generate</strong>. This will allow social sites to display the thumbnail image, title, and description of the first video when viewers share your experience.</p>

    <h2 id="seo">Accessing SEO settings</h2>
    <p>The SEO settings allow you to generate a site map and search feed for the In-Page experience. To access the SEO settings, edit the experience and then click <strong>SETTINGS &gt; SEO</strong> in the left navigation.</p>
    <p>To generate a site map and/or search feed, follow these steps:</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>To configure the Search Engine Optimization settings for a portal experience, edit the experience and click <strong>SITE CONFIGURATION &gt; Search Engine Optimization</strong> in the left navigation. The following settings are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#details">Site Details</a> - Configure the site image, keywords and meta tags</li>
      <li><a href="#sitemap">Site Map</a> - Access the site map and search feed URLs</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="details">Configuring the site details</h2>
    <p>The Site Details settings can be configured to control how the portal is indexed by search engines. To access the Search Engine Optimization settings, edit the experience and click <strong>SITE CONFIGURATION &gt; Search Engine Optimization</strong> in the left navigation.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node18673-site-details.png" /></figure>
    <p>The following settings can be configured:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use site description in search engine results and when site is shared</strong> - When checked, will use the site description in the &lt;meta&gt; description tags, including the Facebook and Twitter meta tags. If not checked, the description for the featured video is used.</li>
      <li><strong>Site Image</strong> - This is the image that will be shown when the home page of a portal site is shared on Facebook or Twitter.</li>
      <li><strong>Keywords</strong> - Meta keywords that will be added to all site pages. Adding "birds,animals,fish, animal world" will result in the following being added to the page HTML:<br />
        <code>&lt;meta name="keywords" content="birds,animals,fish,animal world"&gt;</code></li>
      <li><strong>Meta Tags</strong> - Used to add additional meta tags for the site. These tags will be added to all site pages. Example:<br />
        <code>&lt;meta name="myCustomTag" content="myCustomValue"&gt;</code></li>
      <li><strong>Include custom video fields in page metadata</strong> - When checked, will add custom fields as meta tags. For example, a custom field of <strong>year</strong> with a value of <strong>2018</strong> will add:<br />
        <code>&lt;meta name="year" content="2018"&gt;</code></li>
      <li><strong>Include canonical URL in page metadata</strong> - When checked, will add a <code><strong>rel=canonical</strong></code> meta tag in the source which helps improve SEO. This is a feature that tells Google to treat all the pages with the same <code>rel=canonical</code> link as a single entry. For example, mysite.com/video/mypage.html is the same as mysite.com/video/mypage.html?username=foobar.</li>
      <li><strong>Remove video titles from their URLs</strong> - When checked, the video name will not be included as part of the URL to the video detail page, just the video ID will be in the URL.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="sitemap">Viewing the site map &amp; search feed</h2>
    <p>The Site Map settings display the URLs for the site map and search feed. The site map can be downloaded and submitted to search engines. The search feed can be used by most search engine software as a way to add Gallery content to search results. To access the Search Engine Optimization settings, edit the experience and click <strong>SITE CONFIGURATION &gt; Search Engine Optimization</strong> in the left navigation.</p>
    <p>To include the video tags in the site map, check the <strong>Include video tags in site map</strong> option. Note that only the first 32 tags are included. Adding tags to the site map exposes them to search engine web crawlers allowing visitors to find videos based on the video tags.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: These URLs will not be available until the site is published.</aside>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node18673-sitemap.png" /></figure>
    <p>Site maps are cached for 24 hours. After 24 hours, they are removed from the cache and will be re-generated when they are accessed again. If videos are added to a portal experience, they will not be included in the site map until the site map is re-generated (after 24 hours) or until the site is republished.</p>

    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/inpage/node16793-tracking.png" /></figure>
    <p>By providing a Google Analytics Tracking ID in the Tracking page, events occurring on the experience will be submitted to a Google Analytics account. Each event has a category in the form of <strong>Brightcove Experience {name} - {state}</strong> where <strong>{name}</strong> is the name of the experience, and <strong>{state}</strong> is the current playback state of the component (before, during, after). Each event may also have a relevant label, which is usually the ID of the video on which the event occurs. The following events are currently tracked (more will be added in the future as needed):</p>
