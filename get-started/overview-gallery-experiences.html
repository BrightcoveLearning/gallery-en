    <p>Brightcove Gallery makes it easy to create powerful, engaging video experiences without the need for any custom development. Gallery allows you to create the following types of experiences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#portal">Portal</a></li>
      <li><a href="#inpage">In-Page</a></li>
      <li><a href="#landing">Landing Page</a></li>
      <li><a href="#event">Event</a></li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you are looking to quickly get started creating and publishing a Gallery experience, check out one of the step-by-step topics for creating <a href="/get-started/step-step-creating-and-publishing-portal-experience.html">Portal</a> or <a href="/get-started/step-step-creating-and-publishing-page-experience.html">In-Page</a> experiences.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The types of experiences you have access to is based upon your Brightcove subscription.</aside>
    <p>When you select the type of experience to create, Gallery provides a set of templates for both <a href="/experiences/portal/templates/overview-gallery-portal-templates.html">Portal</a> (which include Landing Page and Event experiences) and <a href="/experiences/inpage/overview-gallery-page-experience-templates.html">In-Page</a> experiences that control the overall look and feel of the experience.</p>

    <h2 id="portal">Portal</h2>
    <p>Portal Experiences are standalone video sites (i.e. video portals) that are accessed at a specified URL hosted by Brightcove. In the following example, Video Cloud and Gallery training videos have been organized into a Portal Experience. Selecting a category on the left displays the associated videos in that category in the body of the page.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="inpage">In-Page</h2>
    <p>In-Page Experiences are embedded inside of an existing web page. In-Page Experiences allow you to create a video layout and display it inside of your existing website. In-Page Experiences support both in-player and outside the player interactivity such as links and cards that can be displayed as the video plays. In the following example, an In-Page Experience (the video thumbnails) has been embedded inside of an existing web page. Clicking one of the video thumbnails opens a video player in a lightbox.</p>

    <h2 id="landing">Landing Page</h2>
    <p>Landing Page experiences are single video pages hosted by Brightcove and are typically used as part of an email campaign. When a user clicks on a link in an email message, they are redirected to a Landing Page experience where they can view a single video. The example below also contains a lead form which can be used to capture viewer information.</p>

    <h2 id="event">Event</h2>
    <p>Event experiences include both Live Event and Virtual Event experiences.</p>
    <h3>Live Event</h3>
    <p>Live Event experiences allow you to engage your audience before, during, and after your live event by creating a branded pre-event destination, a live stream event page, and a post-event video archive. Event experiences can be created as standalone, portal sites or embedded into an existing page as an In-Page experience. In the following example, a live event portal has been created and is configured to display the pre-event state (notice the countdown timer on the home page).</p>

    <h3>Virtual Event</h3>
    <p>Virtual Event experiences can be used to deliver immersive, live experiences. Easily create and manage an event agenda, add speakers and sponsors. Q&amp;A, polling, and live chat are also supported.</p>
