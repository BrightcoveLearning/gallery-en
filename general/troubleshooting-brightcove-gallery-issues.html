    <h2>Issues when configuring a site to use SSL</h2>
    <p>Requirements to configure a Gallery Portal Experience are outlined in the <a href="/settings/securing-portal-experience-ssl.html">Securing a Portal Experience with SSL</a> document. Common issues are listed here.</p>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>The keys were copied incorrectly</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure there are no white spaces around the values</li>
        <li>Make sure the full key was copied. Make sure the ‘-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----’ and ‘-----END CERTIFICATE-----’ were included.</li>
        <li>The public key should start and end with ‘-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----’ and ‘-----END CERTIFICATE-----’ respectively. The private key should start and end with ‘-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----’ and ‘-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----’</li>
        <li>The certificate chain can have multiple concatenated keys</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>The key is not in PEM format</h3>
      <p>Check with the issuer of the certificates to make sure the key is in PEM format.</p>

      <h3>Incorrect line endings</h3>
      <p>If the key was transferred between a Linux and Windows machine, there is a very low chance that the line endings may have gotten corrupted. See <a href="https://www.editpadpro.com/tricklinebreak.html">this link</a> for more information.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>The public key and private key don’t match</h3>
      <p>This is a rare case. One way to check if a key matches is described in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/280912/1351692">this link</a>.</p>

    <h2>Pages are showing up blank in Internet Explorer 9 and 10</h2>
    <p>The site should not be viewed using the Compatibility View mode in Internet Explorer. By default, Gallery pages load in "non-compatibility" mode and should display correctly using IE 9 and 10. See <a href="/general/gallery-system-requirements.html">Brightcove Gallery System Requirements</a> for more information.</p>

    <h2>I made changes to my site but they don't appear</h2>
    <p>After you make changes to a Gallery experience, you must republish it before the changes will appear. Experiences that need to be republished will display a <strong>PUBLISH CHANGES</strong> link as part of the experience details. For more information, see <a href="/experiences/portal/publishing/previewing-and-publishing-portal-experience.html">Publishing changes to a site</a>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: You may also need to clear the browser cache and cookies if changes aren't appearing.</aside>

    <h2>I enabled the social sharing options for the site but they don't appear</h2>
    <p>By default, the social sharing icons use a light color scheme and may be impossible or hard to see when your site also uses a light color scheme. For more information on how to change the icon color scheme, see the <a href="/experiences/portal/customizing/customizing-social-settings-portal-experience.html">Customizing the Social Settings for a Portal Experience</a>.</p>

    <h2>I selected the option to host on my own domain but I don't see my site</h2>
    <p>In order to host a site on your own domain, you have to add the domain as part of the Gallery settings, assign the domain as part of the site properties and also add a CNAME record with your hosting provider. For more information, see <a href="/experiences/portal/publishing/assigning-custom-domain-portal-experience.html">Assigning a Custom Domain to a Portal Experience</a>.</p>

    <h2>I updated the video title and/or description in Video Cloud but I don't see the update on my site</h2>
    <p>Gallery uses the Video Cloud <span translate="No">CMS API</span> to get video information. <span translate="No">CMS API</span> calls are cached to improve performance. It may take anywhere from 5 - 15 minutes before changes made to video metadata are reflected in the Gallery module.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2>I tagged a video (or updated custom fields, playlist, etc) and I don't see it when creating collections in Gallery</h2>
    <p>Gallery uses the Video Cloud <span translate="No">CMS API</span> to get video information. <span translate="No">CMS API</span> calls are cached to improve performance. It may take anywhere from 5 - 15 minutes before changes made to video metadata are reflected in the Gallery module.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2>When adding videos to collections, the wrong videos appear or no videos are added to the site</h2>
    <p>Check to make sure your Video Cloud account is enabled for HTTP delivery. We have seen strange issues when trying to add videos to collections when HTTP delivery is not enabled. The HTTP delivery setting is also required for the download video feature and for generating site maps.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Search Error: Long Query Strings</h2>
    <p>When using the Video Security option with a large number of collections and custom filters, search queries can become too long, leading to errors in the CMS API. The generated search query strings should not exceed 2000 characters to avoid these errors.</p>
