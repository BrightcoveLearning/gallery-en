  <h1>Gallery System Requirements</h1>
  <summary>This page summarizes the software and hardware requirements for working with Brightcove Gallery, as well as requirements for Brightcove Players.</summary>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: As of June 15th, 2021, Brightcove will no longer actively support Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on any version of Windows. Related bug reports and enhancement requests will not be accepted after this date. While we will not intentionally remove IE 11 support in any version of Brightcove Player 6.x, we will not be actively testing against it either. Customers requiring support for IE 11 may wish to <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/players/setting-player-update-mode-and-version.html">lock their player</a> to the last version released before June 15th to ensure continued functionality. Note that locked players no longer receive new enhancements or bug fixes. Edge is the recommended Microsoft browser and is fully supported by the Brightcove team.</aside>
